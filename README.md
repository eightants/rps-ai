# PARIS: A Rock, Paper, Scissors AI

PARIS is an AI that demonstrates the adaptability of simple algorithms. It learns to identify patterns in a person's previous decisions and predicts future behavior. PARIS operates under the assumption that more recent events are more important in a person's decision. It aims to find out the number of previous moves that should be considered for the best behavior prediction.
